# Neural-Network
This is  Andrew Ng's classic "Deep Learning" problem/ building a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats (meow!) with a Neural Network Mindset. 

-The project takes these steps into consideration:

1-Common steps of pre-processing a new data set

-Figure out the dimension an d the shape of the process (m-train, m-test, num_px)

-Reshape dataset to have it vectorized to avoid working with loops and slowing down our algorithm

-standarize the data

2-Building the Algorithms 

3-Assembling them in one model and start predicting
